Name: Karim El Asmar

National of: Lebanon x Brazil

Description: 

I am 22 years old, I lived in Lebanon for 18 years. Afterwards, I decided to challenge myself and start my undergrad in France to discover a new culture and new horizons.

I got accepted in the Lycée Privé Sainte-Geneviève, a preparatory school in France, where I studied a wide range of topics from advanced mathematics to philosophy, which helped me develop skills such as critical thinking and flexibility. Last year, I achieved my Master of Engineering at CentraleSupelec. 

If I had to explain these choices, I would say that I wanted to follow a path of excellence in engineering. However, I don't want to be an engineer. I chose this path for two significant reasons: I think that engineering rhymes with rigor, efficiency, and analytical skills, and I feel that it's a background that keeps the doors open for a reconversion.

In particular, I want to work as an Investment Analyst in an Investment Bank. My professional experience has strongly driven my choice. I have been working for a fintech startup SkillZ since September 2019. I worked on several projects that were focused on the implementation of blockchain in the financial world. I had a brief insight of the ecosystem and now it is the time for me to deepen my knowledge in the field. Last year, I also interned in a Lebanese VC as a Venture Capital Analyst. What struck me in the VC world was the diversity of tasks. As a matter of example, I monitored a due diligence, met with entrepreneurs, and worked on a follow-on round. Finally, the turning point in my career was my spring at Credit Suisse. In fact, it was a great introduction to Investment Banking, and I aim to follow this path.

To sum up, I would describe myself as an ambitious finance student at LBS who wants to start his career as an Investment Analyst in an Investment Bank.
